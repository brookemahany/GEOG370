    <h1>Homework 6b</h1>
    <p>Using the American Community Survey data on <a href = https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDP1Y2022.DP03?t=Industry&g=040XX00US42,42$0600000">Selected Economic Characteristics (DPO3)</a>, I created a ratio that shows 
        the percentage of the over 16, working population in each county currently in the manufacturing industry. I did this 
        by putting the amount of people in the manufacturing column over the total workforce column in the QGIS field 
        calculator. I used the function ("manu_emp"/"total_emp")*10 so that the data displayed would be whole numbers.

    <p>This map uses the Equal Count (Quantile) method of classifying data in QGIS. The Quantile method of classification divides up the data so that
        each class as an equal amount of features. The pros of this method are that it neatly divides the data, and it can be good for evenly distributed
        data. However, there is not a lot of nuance in the sense that it can group a wide range of values into a single class. It might also put similar
        values in different classes.

    <p>This map uses the Equal Interval method of classifying data in QGIS. The Equal Interval method puts the data into different classes with the same ranges.
        For example, in the Quantile map, there is a class from 3-5 (range of 2) and the next class is from 5-6.2 (range of 1.2). However, all the classes in this map have
        a range of 1.6. The pros of this method are that it easily allows you to easily show continuous data. The disadvantage of this classification system is that
        there also might be too many values in a class. This is good for when you have a lot of data which several large differences in values. However, this data may not be 
        good for differentiating extrenes from each other, and may put a wide range of higher numbers, for example, in the same class.

 <p>This map uses the Natural Breaks method, which is used by dividing up obvious groups in the data.
