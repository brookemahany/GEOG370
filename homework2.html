            Located in the Rust Belt and just southeast of the famed Steel City of Pittsburgh, Beaver County, Pennsylvania is home to several important industrial assets. Western Pennsylvania sits on top
            of the Marcellus and Utica shale formations; the town of Conway houses one of the largest railyards in the United States; the county is encompassed by rich bituminous coal fields; and though
            the industry has since declined, Beaver County was once a large producer of steel (Shell plc, 2016; Socolow, n.d.; Beaver County, Pennsylvania, n.d.). All of these factors combine to paint the picture of Beaver County and it's environmental plight in 2023. Promised to be a huge economic development, 
            the Shell Petrochemicals Complex was completed in 2022 and has produced millions of polyethylene plastic pellets (Shell plc, 2016). The plant raises several concerns about the environment in Beaver County and it's 
            surroundings. While there are several regulations the plant should follow under Pennsylvania law and the EPA's National Pollution Discharge Elimiination System, 
            Shell has already been required to pay $10 million dollars in fines for various malfunctions and violations related to water and air pollution (PublicSource, 2023). 
            The 2023 Norfolk-Southern train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio has also had consequences for Beaver County's environment. The crash occured hardly a mile from the Ohio-Beaver County border, 
            and Little Beaver Creek has tested positive for occasional low-levels of glycol (Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, 2023). </p>
           <p> This map shows the boundaries of Beaver County, the Pennsylvania portion of the Ohio River, and their relation to the East Palestine train derailment as well as the Shell Petrochemicals Complex in Potter Township.
            The map shows how these incidents lead into the larger issue of pollution in the Ohio River. </p>
